* What is this?                                                        :what:
These Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (Linux-PAM) configuration
rules support using both "Universal 2nd Factor" (U2F) and "Time-based
One-time Password" (TOTP) or "HMAC-based One-time Password" (HOTP) for
"Two-Factor Authentication" (2FA) by using Google's
=pam_google_authenticator.so= library and Yubico's =pam_u2f.so=
library.

* Why did you write this?                                               :why:
Because I wanted to have a similar log-in workflow in my computers to
the 2FA workflow that some online services provide:

- Validate the user's password (part of =common-auth=).
- Prompt for a U2F key if the user registered at least one.
- If the user doesn't have their key or hasn't registered one,
  fallback to a TOTP/HTOP code from a TOTP/HTOP authenticator app.
- If the user doesn't have both their key, nor the TOTP/HTOP app
  fallback to a rescue code (from the authenticator app).
- Succeed if the user hasn't registered any 2FA methods.

This allows one to introduce other family members or co-workers to a
2FA workflow, and it helps system administrators to reduce the risk of
account takeover by malicious actors because of weak passwords.

* Installation                                                 :installation:
Please make sure you have already met these two prerequisites:
- having installed and configured [[https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/][=pam_google_authenticator.so=]]
- having installed and configured [[https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f][=pam_u2f.so=]]

Let's, for example, add the =custom-2fa= rules to =/etc/pam.d/sudo=:
- copy =custom-2fa= file into =/etc/pam.d/=:
  - =sudo cp custom-2fa /etc/pam.d/=
- edit (and don't close until we verify it works) =/etc/pam.d/sudo=:
  - =sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sudo=
- include =@include custom-2fa= after =@include common-auth= line, and
  save file without exiting the editor or closing the terminal
  emulator (see example below with included comments)
- in another terminal emulator window or tab, verify installation:
  - =sudo -k && sudo echo "Hello World!"=
  - if you were able to successfully authenticate, you may close both
    windows
  - if there was an error, see the Debugging section
  - worst case scenario, you can comment the =@include custom-2fa=
    line to disable =custom-2fa= in the editor that still has root
    privileges that you totally didn't close.

You may probably want to add =custom-2fa= to the following rule files:

- =/etc/pam.d/sudo=
- =/etc/pam.d/gdm-password=
- =/etc/pam.d/login=

Additionally, you may also want to place some comments, so you
remember how you configured your system.  I use the following format:

#+begin_src text
  # custom-2fa
  # - Prompts for FIDO2-capable U2F device
  # - If present, request touch of device
  # - Otherwise request a TOTP/HOTP validation code
  # - Allow for users without 2FA to authenticate with password
  # note: see /etc/pam.d/custom-2fa for implementation details
  @include custom-2fa
#+end_src

** WARNING!                                                        :warning:

Make sure you have several terminal emulators with root privileges
open so that you can undo changes that would leave you without
superuser access.

* Usage                                                               :usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code :eval never :dir ~ :wrap SRC text
user@computer:~$ sudo echo "Hello, World!"
#+END_SRC

And the expected workflow in the terminal is:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
[sudo] password for user: 
insert key and/or press ENTER: 
touch key: 
Hello, World!
#+END_SRC

This can also be set as a prompt when logging in (see Installation):

* About                                                               :about:
** Linux-PAM configuration rules                    :linux:pam:config:rules:

The files are made of lists of rules.  Each rule is a space separated
collection of tokens:

=service type control module-path module-arguments=

The files in =/etc/pam.d/= lack the "service" field.  Some info
regarding each field:
- service :: usually carry the name of the service or name of a
  familiar application, like "login" and "sudo".
- type :: the management group that the rule corresponds to
- control :: indicates behavior of PAM-API if module fails to
  authenticate.  Two types of syntax are used:  simple key word, and
  square-bracketed value=action pairs.
- module-path :: full filename (begins with "=/=") of the PAM to be
  used or relative path-name from default location (which could be
  either =/lib/security/=, =/lib64/security/=, or
  =/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/=)

** These custom-2fa rules                                 :custom:2fa:rules:

These Linux-PAM configuration rules support using both U2F and
TOTP/HOTP for 2FA by using =pam_google_authenticator.so= and
=pam_u2f.so=.

*** What is accomplished?                                         :results:

- Prompt for a U2F device, and to then press ENTER.
  - In case the U2F device is known, prompt the user to press the
    tactile trigger.
  - In case the U2F device is not known or present, prompt for code
    for verification from TOTP/HOTP app (like Google Authenticator).
- Allow users that are not configured to use U2F or TOTP/HOTP to log
  in.

*** rule 1: request U2F key; press ENTER and detect key             :first:

- management group type
  - =auth= :: module type that authenticates the user
- control values
  - =default=ignore= :: the module's return status will not contribute
    to the return code the application obtains
  - =ignore=ignore= :: PAM module wants its result to be ignored
  - =new_authtok_reqd=ok= :: new authentication token is required
  - =success=1= :: Jump over the N modules in the stack on success
- module path
    - =pam_u2f.so= :: use Yubico's =pam_u2f=
- module arguments
  - =authfile=/etc/2fa/u2f/u2f_mappings= :: Sets the location of the
    file that holds the mappings of user names to keyHandles and user
    keys; should have =0600= permissions
  - =interactive= :: Set to prompt a message and wait before testing
    the presence of a FIDO device.  Recommended if your device doesn't
    have a tactile trigger
  - =nouserok= :: Set to enable authentication attempts to succeed
    even if the user trying to authenticate is not found inside
    authfile or if authfile is missing/malformed
  - =[prompt=insert key and/or press ENTER: ]= :: Specify the prompt
    to insert a U2F key and press ENTER; hint at TOTP option
  - =userpresence=0= :: If =1=, request user presence during
    authentication.  If =0=, do not request user presence during
    authentication.  Otherwise, fallback to the authenticator's
    default behavior.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  auth \
      [success=1 new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=ignore] \
          pam_u2f.so \
              authfile=/etc/2fa/u2f/u2f_mappings \
              interactive \
              nouserok \
              [prompt=insert key and/or press ENTER: ] \
              userpresence=0
#+END_SRC

*** rule 2: if no key was inserted, ask for TOTP token             :second:

- management group type
  - =auth= :: module type that authenticates the user
- control values
  - =default=bad= :: should be thought of as indicative of the
    module failing
  - =ignore=ignore= :: PAM module wants its result to be ignored
  - =new_authtok_reqd=ok= :: new authentication token is required
  - =success=1= :: Jump over the N modules in the stack on success
- module path
  - =pam_google_authenticator.so= :: google-authenticator-libpam,
    by Google, will be used
- module arguments
  - =[authtok_prompt=Type in token: ]= :: set token prompt
  - =nullok= :: OK if user doesn't have TOTP/HOTP 2FA rolled out
  - =secret=/etc/2fa/totp/${USER}/.totp_secrets= :: the nonstandard
    location for the file holding the secrets; it should have =0600=
    permissions

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  auth \
      [success=1 new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=bad] \
          pam_google_authenticator.so \
              [authtok_prompt=type in token: ] \
              nullok \
              secret=/etc/2fa/totp/${USER}/.totp_secrets
#+END_SRC

*** rule 3: if U2F key was inserted, request touch                  :third:

- management group type
  - =auth= :: module type that authenticates the user
- control values
  - =required= :: failure of such a PAM will ultimately lead to the
    PAM-API returning failure but only after the remaining stacked
    modules (for this service and type) have been invoked.  This is a
    shorthand for the following values:
    - =[success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=bad]=
- module path
  - =pam_u2f.so= :: use Yubico's =pam_u2f=
- module arguments
  - =authfile=/etc/2fa/u2f/u2f_mappings= :: Sets the location of the
    file that holds the mappings of user names to keyHandles and user
    keys; should have =0600= permissions
  - =cue= :: Set to prompt a message to remind to touch the device
  - =[cue_prompt=Touch key: ]= :: Specify prompt to touch key
  - =nouserok= :: Set to enable authentication attempts to succeed
    even if the user trying to authenticate is not found inside
    authfile or if authfile is missing/malformed.
  - =userpresence=1= :: If =1=, request user presence during
    authentication.  If =0=, do not request user presence during
    authentication.  Otherwise, fallback to the authenticator's
    default behavior.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  auth \
      required \
          pam_u2f.so \
              authfile=/etc/2fa/u2f/u2f_mappings \
              cue \
              [cue_prompt=touch key: ] \
              nouserok \
              userpresence=1
#+END_SRC

** Debugging & Troubleshooting                   :debugging:troubleshooting:

First, it may be useful to identify which files use custom-2fa: =grep
-irlE "^#?@include custom-2fa" /etc/pam.d/ --exclude=custom=

After that, try to pinpoint if the problem is with =pam_u2f= (rules 1
and 3), or with =pam_google_authenticator= (rule 2).  Then enable
debug logging, try authenticating again, and inspect the output.
Remember to escape previous line breaks with "=\=" when adding module
arguments to the PAM rules.

For =pam_u2f= (rules 1 and 3):
- Enable debug logging:
  - =sudo touch /var/log/pam_u2f.log=
  - add "=debug=" as an additional module argument
  - optionally, also add "=debug_file=/var/log/pam_u2f.log="
- Try authenticating again:
  - =sudo -k && sudo echo "Hello World!"=
- Inspect debug logs:
  - if =debug_file= was not specified, output will be on stderr
  - if =debug_file= was specified:
    - inspect it: =nano /var/log/pam_u2f.log=
    - remove it: =sudo rm /var/log/pam_u2f.log=

For =pam_google_authenticator= (rule 2):
- Enable debug logging
  - add "=debug=" as an additional module argument
- Begin monitoring syslog:
  - open shell and monitor with: =tail -f /var/log/auth.log=
- Try authenticating again:
  - in another shell: =sudo -k && sudo echo "Hello World!"=

* Why did I include so much info and not just a README?                 :tmi:
Well, ... why not both?  Honestly, sometimes you don't want to be
scouring through the Internet to try to grok rules that you wrote
several months ago.  So I decided to include most of this README in
the actual source as comments.
